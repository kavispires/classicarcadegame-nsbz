----------------------------
#### Collectables
You need to collect **all** the CDs on the screen in order to be allowed on stage, after all, the Nerdstreet Boys don't sing live, they need the playback cds to lipsync to.
On early levels there is only one CD to be collected, but they are added in order you are archieving new levels. Each CD grants you 10 extra poins, no matter the color.

_The order CDs are collected is irrelevant, so collect first the ones that are in easier reach._

#### Hazards
----------------------------
Watch out for hazards! Crazy fans throw sharpy love letters and panties all the time, and sometimes even a plastic bottle may be thrown by a jealous boyfriend. The more famous you are, more haters you have on your neck.

_When a hazard touches you, you lose a life and your position is reset. You do NOT need to collect previous collected CDs, just the remaining ones._

----------------------------
#### Security Guards
The security guards are there to help you. Eh... I mean, they actually just block the way. That's what happens when you hire the cheapest security firm.

_But be aware that hazards can go through Security Guards and still hit you._

----------------------------
#### Extra Life
You gain 1 extra life (maximum of 3) every 10 levels you complete.

----------------------------
#### Game Over
Everytime you loses all 3 lives, the game is over and you can restart from the beginning. Moreover, you will be reassigned a new character.

----------------------------
#### Pause Menu
You may pause the game at any time by hitting the ``space bar`` or the ``p`` key on your keyboard.
When paused, you may randomly assign another Nerdstreet Character at random to continue the game.

----------------------------
#### Music & Sound Effects
You may turn off sound by clicking the speaker icon button in the top left bar.

_If you wish to disable **only** the music, but keep sound effects, you can hit the ``m`` key on your keyboard._

### Good Luck and have a great concert!
